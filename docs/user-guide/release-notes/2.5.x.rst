Pulp 2.5 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.5.0
==========

The 2.5.0 release of ``pulp-puppet`` is a minor update release with bugfixes
and one new feature. The ``--skip-dep`` and ``--modulepath`` flags are now
supported during install and update operations.

Users upgrading from 2.3.x or earlier will need to manually delete the
``/var/www/pulp_puppet`` directory after upgrading. This is the old location
for puppet module publishing in Pulp 2.3 but is no longer used. The directory
should be empty after the migration is complete.

You can see the :fixedbugs:`list of bugs fixed<2.5.0>`.
